## 🔎 Project Overview

This project analyzes 3,900 customer shopping transactions to uncover patterns in spending, product preferences, and subscription behavior, then translates those patterns into concrete business recommendations — the same workflow a retail analytics team would follow end to end.

## 🗂 Dataset

- **3,900 rows × 18 columns** of retail transaction data
- Customer demographics: age, gender, location, subscription status
- Purchase details: item, category, amount, season, size, color
- Behavior signals: discount usage, previous purchases, purchase frequency, review rating, shipping type
- **37 missing values** in `Review Rating` — imputed with the median rating per product category

---

## ❓ Business Questions

This analysis was scoped to answer:

- Which gender contributes the most revenue?
- Do customers who use discounts still spend above average?
- Which products are rated highest by customers?
- Does shipping type affect purchase amount?
- Does subscription status affect spending or revenue share?
- Which products rely most heavily on discounts to sell?
- How do customers break down by loyalty segment (New / Returning / Loyal)?
- What are the top-selling products within each category?
- Are repeat buyers more likely to subscribe?
- Which age group drives the most revenue?

---

## 🧹 Data Preparation (Python)

- Loaded and inspected the raw CSV with `pandas`
- Imputed missing `Review Rating` values using per-category medians
- Standardized column names to snake_case
- Engineered `age_group` (quartile-based bins) and `purchase_frequency_days` (mapped from purchase frequency labels)
- Verified `discount_applied` and `promo_code_used` were redundant and dropped the latter
- Loaded the cleaned dataset into PostgreSQL for SQL analysis

---

## 📐 Statistical Analysis

Additional checks run in the notebook beyond the core cleaning steps:

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Correlation (age, purchase amount, rating, previous purchases) | All pairwise correlations within ±0.05 — no meaningful relationship between these fields |
| Outlier detection (purchase amount, IQR method) | Upper fence ≈ $144; **zero** values exceed it — spending is bounded ($20–$100), not long-tailed |
| Distribution shape (purchase amount) | Skewness ≈ 0.01 — essentially symmetric, not the typical right-skewed retail spend pattern |

---

## 📌 Business KPIs

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Total Revenue | **$233,081** |
| Average Order Value | **$59.76** |
| Customers | **3,900** |
| Average Review Rating | **3.75** |
| Subscriber Share | **27.0%** |

---

## 📈 Key Findings (SQL)

Ten business questions were answered directly against the cleaned dataset. Full queries are in [`customer_behavior_sql_queries.sql`](./customer_behavior_sql_queries.sql).

| # | Question | Finding |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Revenue by gender | Male customers generate **$157,890** vs. **$75,191** for female customers — roughly double |
| 2 | High-spending discount users | **839 customers** used a discount and still spent above the average purchase amount |
| 3 | Top 5 rated products | Gloves (3.86), Sandals (3.84), Boots (3.82), Hat (3.80), Skirt (3.78) |
| 4 | Standard vs. Express shipping | Express customers spend slightly more on average (**$60.48 vs. $58.46**, ~3.5%) |
| 5 | Subscribers vs. non-subscribers | Non-subscribers spend marginally more on average ($59.87 vs. $59.49); subscribers contribute **27%** of revenue |
| 6 | Most discount-dependent products | Hat (50% of purchases discounted), Sneakers (49.7%), Coat (49.1%), Sweater (48.2%), Pants (47.4%) |
| 7 | Customer segmentation | Loyal: **3,116** (80%) · Returning: **701** (18%) · New: **83** (2%) |
| 8 | Top 3 products per category | Accessories → Jewelry; Clothing → Blouse/Pants; Footwear → Sandals; Outerwear → Jacket |
| 9 | Repeat buyers (>5 purchases) & subscription | 958 subscribe, 2,518 don't — no strong link between repeat buying and subscribing |
| 10 | Revenue by age group | Young Adult ($62,143) leads, followed by Middle-aged, Adult, and Senior — a fairly even spread |

## 📊 Dashboard (Power BI)

<p align="center">
  <img src="./dashboard_preview.png" alt="Power BI dashboard showing customer count, average purchase amount, average review rating, revenue and sales by category, and revenue and sales by age group" width="850">
</p>

Interactive filters for subscription status, gender, category, and shipping type. Open [`customer_behavior_dashboard.pbix`](./customer_behavior_dashboard.pbix) in Power BI Desktop to explore.

## 💡 Business Recommendations

- **Boost subscriptions** — subscribers currently spend about the same as non-subscribers, so the program isn't yet driving extra spend; exclusive perks could change that.
- **Convert New → Returning → Loyal** — only 2% of customers are "New," suggesting strong retention once someone makes a second purchase; worth investigating what drives that early conversion.
- **Rebalance discount strategy** — several products (Hat, Sneakers, Coat) rely on discounts for roughly half their sales; review margin impact.
- **Lean into express shipping** — it correlates with modestly higher spend and could be promoted as an upsell.
- **Target the Young Adult segment** — the highest revenue-contributing age group.

```

## ⚙️ Running It Locally

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Open the notebook and run cells top to bottom. The database connection cells expect a local PostgreSQL instance — set credentials via environment variables rather than hardcoding them:

```python
import os
password = os.environ.get("DB_PASSWORD")
```
